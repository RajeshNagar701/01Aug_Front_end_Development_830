CSS3 is the latest standard for CSS.
CSS3 is completely backwards-compatible with earlier versions of CSS.
This section teaches you about the new features in CSS3!

CSS3 Modules
CSS3 has been split into "modules". It contains the 
"old CSS specification" (which has been split into smaller pieces). 
In addition, new modules are added.

Some of the most important CSS3 modules are:

Selectors
Box Model
Backgrounds and Borders
Image Values and Replaced Content
Text Effects
2D/3D Transformations
Animations
Multiple Column Layout 
User Interface
media Queries for create responsive template for dekstop/tablet/mobile

Most of the CSS3 Modules are W3C Recommendations, 
and most of the new CSS3 properties are already implemented in
 modern browsers.
