<!--
The Rendering Context
The <canvas> is initially blank, and to display something, a script first needs to access the
rendering context and draw on it.
The canvas element has a DOM method called getContext, used to obtain the rendering context
and its drawing functions. This function takes one parameter, the type of context 2d.
Following is the code to get required context along with a check if your browser supports
<canvas> element âˆ’


-->


<canvas id="myCanvas" width="200" height="100" style="border:1px solid #d3d3d3;">
Your browser does not support the HTML canvas tag.
</canvas>

<script>
var c = document.getElementById("myCanvas");


var ctx = c.getContext("2d");
ctx.moveTo(0,0); // first point work on width start point & height
ctx.lineTo(200,100); //end point work on width & height
ctx.stroke();
</script>
