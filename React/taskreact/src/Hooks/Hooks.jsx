React Hooks

Hooks were added to React in version 16.8.

Hooks allow function components to have access to state and other React features. 
Because of this, class components are generally no longer needed.

Hooks allow us to "hook" into React features such as state and lifecycle methods.

There are 3 rules for hooks:

Hooks can only be called inside React function components.
Hooks can only be called at the top level of a component.
Hooks cannot be conditional

If you have stateful logic that needs to be reused in several components, 
you can build your own custom Hooks.

useState
useEffect
useContext
useRef
useReducer
useCallback
use Memo
